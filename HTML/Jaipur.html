        <h1>Jaipur (Pink City):</h1>

        <div class="hawamahal">
            <h2>1. Hawamahal Jaipur</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. 
                Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, 
                Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.
                <br><br>
                The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson 
                of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state 
                of Rajasthan. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that 
                he built this grand and historical palace.
                <br><br>
                It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a 
                honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate 
                latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal 
                ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below 
                without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the 
                Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during 
                the high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the 
                street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.
                <br><br>
                In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, 
                to give a facelift to the monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568  million. 
                The corporate sector lent a hand to preserve the historical monuments of Jaipur 
                and the Unit Trust of India has adopted Hawa Mahal to maintain it. The palace 
                is an extended part of a huge complex. The stone-carved screens, small casements, 
                and arched roofs are some of the features of this popular tourist spot. The monument 
                also has delicately modelled hanging cornices.
            </p>

            <h3>Architecture</h3>

            <p>This palace is a five-story pyramidal shaped monument that rises to about 50 feet (15 m). 
                The top three floors of the structure have the width of a single room, while the first 
                and second floors have patios in front of them. The front elevation, as seen from the 
                street, is like a honeycomb with small portholes. Each porthole has miniature windows 
                and carved sandstone grills, finials and domes. It gives the appearance of a mass of 
                semi-octagonal bays, giving the monument its unique façade. The inner face on the back 
                side of the building consists of chambers built with pillars and corridors with minimal 
                ornamentation, and reach up to the top floor. The interior of the palace has been described 
                as "having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels or gilding while 
                fountains adorn the centre of the courtyard".
                <br><br>
                Lal Chand Ustad was the architect. Built-in red and pink coloured sandstone, in keeping with 
                the décor of the other monuments in the city, its colour is a full testimony to the epithet 
                of "Pink City" given to Jaipur. Its façade with 953 niches with intricately carved jharokhas 
                (some are made of wood) is a stark contrast to the plain-looking rear side of the structure. 
                Its cultural and architectural heritage is a reflection of a fusion of Hindu Rajput architecture 
                and Islamic Mughal architecture; the Rajput style is seen in the form of domed canopies, fluted 
                pillars, lotus, and floral patterns, and the Islamic style as evident in its stone inlay filigree 
                work and arches (as distinguished from its similarity with the Panch Mahal at Fatehpur Sikri).
                <br><br>
                The entry to the Hawa Mahal from the city palace side is through an imperial door. It opens 
                into a large courtyard, which has double-storeyed buildings on three sides, with the Hawa Mahal 
                enclosing it on the east side. An archaeological museum is also housed in this courtyard.
                <br><br>
                Hawa Mahal was also known as the chef-d'œuvre of Maharaja Jai Singh as it was his favourite 
                resort because of the elegance and built-in interior of the Mahal. The cooling effect in the 
                chambers, provided by the breeze passing through the small windows of the façade, was enhanced 
                by the fountains provided at the centre of each of the chambers.
                <br><br>
                The top two floors of the Hawa Mahal are accessed only through ramps. The Mahal is maintained 
                by the archaeological department of the Government of Rajasthan.

            <h2>2. Jantar Mantar Jaipur</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>The Jantar Mantar, Jaipur is a collection of 19 astronomical instruments built by 
                the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of Jaipur, Rajasthan. The monument 
                was completed in 1734. It features the world's largest stone sundial, and 
                is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is near City Palace and Hawa Mahal. 
                The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye. 
                The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy which was shared 
                by many civilizations.
                <br><br>
                The monument features instruments operating in each of the three main classical celestial 
                coordinate systems: the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system, and the ecliptic 
                system. The Kanmala Yantraprakara is one that works in two systems and allows transformation 
                of the coordinates directly from one system to the other. It has the biggest sundial in the world.
                <br><br>
                The monument was damaged in the 19th century. Early restoration work was undertaken under the supervision 
                of Major Arthur Garrett, a keen amateur astronomer, during his appointment as Assistant State Engineer for 
                the Jaipur District.

            <h3>History</h3>
            
            <p>Exactly when Raja Jai Singh began construction in Jaipur is unknown, but several instruments had been built 
                by 1728, and the construction of the instruments in Jaipur continued until 1738. During 1735, when construction 
                was at its peak, at least 23 astronomers were employed in Jaipur, and due to the changing political climate, 
                Jaipur replaced Delhi as Raja Jai Singh's main observatory and remained Jai Singh's central observatory until 
                his death in 1743. The observatory lost support under Isvari Singh (r.1743-1750) because of a succession war 
                between him and his brother. However, Mado Singh (r. 1750–1768), Isvari Singh's successor, supported the observatory, 
                although it did not see the same level of activity as under Jai Singh. Although some restorations were made to the 
                Jantar Mantar under Pratap Singh (r.1778-1803), activity at the observatory died down again. During this time, a 
                temple was constructed and Pratap Singh turned the site of the observatory into a gun factory.

                <br><br><br>
                Bhairav Temple - located within the Jantar Mantar Complex
                Ram Singh (r. 1835–1880) completed restoring the Jantar 
                Mantar in 1876, and even made some of the instruments more 
                durable by inserting lead into the instruments' lines and using 
                stone to restore some of the plaster instruments. However, the observatory 
                soon became neglected again, and was not restored until 1901 under Madho Singh 
                II (r. 1880–1922)

            <h2>3. Amber Fort Jaipur</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                Amer Fort or Amber Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with an area of 4 
                square kilometres (1.5 sq mi)[2] located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. 
                Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur. Amer Fort is known for 
                its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort 
                overlooks Maota Lake, which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace.
                <br><br>
                Amer Palace is great example of Rajput architecture. Some of its buildings and work have influence of Mughal 
                architecture. Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out 
                on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the 
                Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and the 
                Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within 
                the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace. The palace was the residence 
                of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there 
                is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a Goddess of the Chaitanya cult, which was given to Raja Man Singh when 
                he defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh). Raja Man Singh had 
                12 queens so he made 12 rooms, one for each Queen. Each room had a staircase connected to the King’s room but 
                the Queens were not to go upstairs. Raja Jai Singh had only one queen so he built one room equal to three old 
                queen’s rooms.
                <br><br>
                This palace, along with Jaigarh Fort, is located immediately above on the Cheel ka Teela (Hill of Eagles) of 
                the same Aravalli range of hills. The palace and Jaigarh Fort are considered one complex, as the two are 
                connected by a subterranean passage. This passage was meant as an escape route in times of war to enable 
                the royal family members and others in the Amer Fort to shift to the more redoubtable Jaigarh Fort. 
                Annual tourist visitation to the Amer Palace was reported by the Superintendent of the Department of 
                Archaeology and Museums as 5000 visitors a day, with 1.4 million visitors during 2007. At the 37th 
                session of the World Heritage Committee held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in 2013, Amer Fort, along with 
                five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the group Hill 
                Forts of Rajasthan.

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>
                Amber was a Meena state, ruled by a Susawat clan. After Kakil Deo defeated the Susawats he made 
                Amber the capital of Dhundhar after Khoh. Kakil Deo was a son of Dulherai.
                <br><br>
                In early times, the state of Jaipur was known as Amber or Dhundhar and was controlled by Meena chiefs of 
                five different tribes. They were under suzerainty of the Bargurjar Rajput Raja of Deoti. Later a Kachhwaha 
                prince, Dulha Rai, destroyed the sovereignty of Meenas and also defeated Bargurjars of Deoli and took 
                Dhundhar fully under Kachwaha rule.
                <br><br>
                The Amber Fort was originally built by Raja Man Singh. Jai Singh I expanded it in the early 1600's. 
                Improvements and additions were made by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until the Kachwahas 
                shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai Singh II, in 1727.
                <br><br>
                In the medieval period, Amer was known as Dhundar (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western 
                frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards – between 1037 and 1727 AD, until the 
                capital was moved from Amer to Jaipur. The history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers as they 
                founded their empire at Amer.

                Indian state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong 
                defence ring for the city. The fort was originally named Sudershangarh, but it became known as 
                Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar 
                Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's 
                spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his name.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Built mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the king of Jaipur, the fort was constructed as 
                a place of retreat on the summit of the ridge above the city. Walls extended over the surrounding 
                hills, forming fortifications that connected this fort to Jaigarh, the fort above the old capital 
                of Amber. Though the fort never came under attack during the course of its history, it did see 
                some historical events, notably, the treaties with the Maratha forces who warred with Jaipur in 
                the 18th century. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the Europeans of the region, including the 
                British Resident's wife, were moved to Nahargarh fort by the king of Jaipur, Sawai Ram Singh, for 
                their protection.
                <br><br>
                The fort was extended in 1868, during the reign of Sawai Ram Singh. In 1883-92, a range of palaces 
                was built at Nahargarh by Dirgh Patel at a cost of nearly three and a half lakh rupees.[6] The 
                Madhavendra Bhawan, built by Sawai Madho Singh had suites for the queens of Jaipur and at the head 
                was a suite for the king himself. The rooms are linked by corridors and still have some delicate 
                frescoes. Nahargarh was also a hunting residence of the Maharajas.
                <br><br>
                Until April 1944, the Jaipur State government used for its official purposes solar time read from 
                the Samrat Yantra in the Jantar Mantar Observatory, with a gun fired from Nahargarh Fort as the time signal.
                <br><br>
                Some scenes in the movies Rang De Basanti, Shuddh Desi Romance and Sonar Kella were shot at Nahargarh Fort.

            <h2>5. Jal Mahal Jaipur</h2>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                The Jal Mahal Palace is an architectural showcase of the Rajput style of architecture (common in Rajasthan) on a 
                grand scale. The building has a picturesque view of Man Sagar Lake, but owing to its seclusion from land is equally 
                the focus of a viewpoint from the Man Sagar Dam on the eastern side of the lake in front of the backdrop of the 
                surrounding Nahargarh ("tiger-abode") hills. The palace, built with local sandstone, is a three-storied building, 
                with the third floor only existing on the eastern side of the palace. The eastern side is not visible from the road 
                side public promenade, which is the Western side of the palace. The additional lower levels of the eastern side remain 
                underwater when the lake is full. The Jal Mahal has a terrace floor with a garden, and the garden has four Tibaris 
                facing north, south, east and west. The Tibaris are designed in the Bengal roof style architecture while the four 
                octagonal Chhatri on the roof mark the corners of the monument. The palace had suffered subsidence in the past and 
                also partial seepage (plaster work and wall damage equivalent to rising damp) because of water logging, which have 
                been repaired under a restoration project of the Government of Rajasthan.
                <br><br>
                The hills surrounding the lake area, towards the north east of Jaipur, have quartzite rock formations (with a thin 
                layer of soil cover), which is part of the Aravalli hills range. Rock exposures on the surface in some parts of the 
                project area have also been used for constructing buildings. From the northeast, the Kanak Vrindavan valley, where a 
                temple complex sits, the hills slope gently towards the lake edge. Within the lake area, the ground area is made up 
                of a thick mantle of soil, blown sand, and alluvium. Forest denudation, particularly in the hilly areas, has caused 
                soil erosion, compounded by wind and water action. As a result, silt built up in the lake incrementally raises the 
                lake bed.[2] On the terrace of the palace, a garden was built with arched passages. At each corner of this palace 
                semi-octagonal towers were built with an elegant cupola.
                <br><br>
                The restoration works of the early 2000s were not satisfactory and an expert in the field of similar architectural 
                restoration works of Rajasthan palaces examined the designs that could decipher the originally existing designs on 
                the walls, after removing the recent plasterwork. Based on this finding, restoration works were re-done with traditional 
                materials for plastering – the plaster consists of partly organic material: a mortar mix of lime, sand and surkhi mixed 
                with jaggery, guggal and methi powder. It was also noticed that there was hardly any water seepage, except for a little 
                dampness, on the floors below the water level. But the original garden, which existed on the terrace had been lost. Now, 
                a new terrace is being created based on a similar roof garden of the Amer Palace. The building is located near the 
                shoreline of a lake with a maximum depth of 15 ft. As the four stories of the building are built under the water, this 
                means it would be structured on the bottom of the lake.
