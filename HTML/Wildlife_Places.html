                <h2>Ranthambore National Park</h2>
                <p>Ranthambore National Park is a national park in Rajasthan, India, with an area of 
                    1,334 km2 (515 sq mi). It is bounded to the north by the Banas River and to the 
                    south by the Chambal River. It is named after the historic Ranthambore Fort, 
                    which lies within the park.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ranthambore National Park was established as the Sawai Madhopur Game Sanctuary in 
                1955, initially covering an area of 282 km2 (109 sq mi). It was declared one of 
                the Project Tiger reserves in 1973.<br><br>
                Ranthambore Fort was built in the 10th century by Chauhan rulers at 210 m (700 ft) 
                above the surrounding plain. Inside the fort are three red stone temples devoted 
                to Ganesh, Shiva and Ramlalaji. There is a Digamber Jain temple of Sumatinatha and 
                Sambhavanatha. The temples were constructed in the 12th and 13th centuries. Padam 
                Talao is the largest of the many lakes in the park. A red sandstone Jogi Mahal is 
                at the edge of the lake.</p>

                <h2>Sariska Tiger Reserve </h2>
                <p>Sariska Tiger Reserve is a tiger reserve in Alwar district, Rajasthan, India. 
                    It stretches over an area of 881 km2 (340 sq mi) comprising scrub-thorn arid 
                    forests, dry deciduous forests, grasslands, and rocky hills. This area was a 
                    hunting preserve of the Alwar state and was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 
                    1958. It was given the status of a tiger reserve making it a part of India's 
                    Project Tiger in 1978. The wildlife sanctuary was declared a national park in 
                    1982, with a total area of about 273.8 km2 (105.7 sq mi). It is the first 
                    reserve in the world with successfully relocated tigers. It is an important 
                    biodiversity area in the Northern Aravalli leopard and wildlife corridor.
                <br>
                <br>
                The park is a part of the Aravalli Range and the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests 
                ecoregion.[2] It is rich in mineral resources, such as copper. In spite of the Supreme 
                Court's 1991 ban on mining in the area, marble mining continues to threaten the environment.</p>

                <p>Keoladeo National Park, or Keoladeo Ghana National Park, is a national park in Rajasthan, 
                    India. The national park hosts thousands of native, resident and migratory birds, especially 
                    during the winter season, when many different species fly to the Indian subcontinent to 
                    escape winter's wrath further north in Eurasia. At least 400 avian species have been noted or 
                    observed in the national park.

                <br>
                Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, as the Park was formerly named, was declared a protected sanctuary in 
                1971 and established as a national park on 10 March 1982. Due to its exceptional avian biodiversity, 
                it has also been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site (1985).</p>

                <h2>Desert National Park </h2>
                <p>Desert National Park is a national park in the Indian state of Rajasthan, near the towns of 
                    Jaisalmer and Barmer. It is one of the largest national parks, covering an area of 3,162 
                    km2 (1,221 sq mi) in the Thar Desert. Sand dunes form around 44% of the park. The major 
                    landform consists of craggy rocks and compact salt lake bottoms, intermedial areas and 
                    fixed dunes. It was gazetted in 1980.
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite a fragile ecosystem, it harbours an abundance of birdlife, both migratory and resident 
                birds, including short-toed eagle, tawny eagle, spotted eagle, laggar falcon, kestrel, sand grouse 
                and great Indian bustard. Desert National Park has a collection of fossils of animals and plants 
                which are 180 million years old. Some fossils of dinosaurs which are 60 million years old were 
                found in the area.</p>

                <h2>Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>
                <p>Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the Aravalli Range, one of the oldest mountain ranges 
                    in India. It was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1980. The eco-sensitive zone around the sanctuary 
                    was notified on 11 Nov 2020.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary spreads out into a plateau which is about 19 km (12 mi) long and 6 km (3.7 mi) wide. 
                In altitude, it ranges from 300 to 1,722 m (984 to 5,650 ft) at Guru Shikhar,[1] the highest peak in Rajasthan. 
                The rocks are igneous and due to the weathering effect of wind and water, large cavities are common in them.
                The sanctuary is in the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion.</p>
