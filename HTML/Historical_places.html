                <h2>Narghar Fort</h2>
                <p id="paragraphToSpeak">CITY PLACE
                Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of 
                Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence ring for the city. The 
                fort was originally named Sudershangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The 
                popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed 
                construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which 
                thus became known by his name.                
                <br><br>
                Built mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the king of Jaipur, the fort was constructed as a place of 
                retreat on the summit of the ridge above the city. Walls extended over the surrounding hills, forming fortifications 
                that connected this fort to Jaigarh, the fort above the old capital of Amber. Though the fort never came under attack 
                during the course of its history, it did see some historical events, notably, the treaties with the Maratha forces 
                who warred with Jaipur in the 18th century.</p>

                <h2>Jaigarh Fort</h2>
                <p id="paragraphToSpeak">CITY PLACE
                Jaigarh Fort, perched atop the Aravalli Hills overlooking Jaipur, stands as a magnificent symbol of Rajasthan's 
                martial prowess and architectural grandeur. This imposing fortress, also known as the "Fort of Victory," is a 
                testament to the valor and strategic foresight of the Rajput rulers.                
                <br><br>
                The fort's strategic location provides not only a commanding view of the surrounding landscape but also a glimpse 
                into the region's rich history and heritage. Visitors are greeted with awe-inspiring ramparts, bastions, and watchtowers 
                that once served as formidable defenses against enemy invasions.
                <br><br>
                One of the most remarkable features of Jaigarh Fort is its massive cannon, Jaivana, which holds the Guinness World 
                Record for being the world's largest cannon on wheels. This engineering marvel showcases the technological advancements 
                of its time and highlights the fort's significance in defending the kingdom.

                <h2>Neemrana Fort</h2>
                <p id="paragraphToSpeak">CITY PLACE
                The story of Neemrana begins in 1977 when, while writing a book, Aman Nath and Francis Wacziarg first saw its 
                15th century ruins lit up by the setting sun. They were researching for a book on the frescoes: The Painted 
                Walls of Shekhavati. The Neemrana fort on the Aravalli range in Rajasthan seemed captivating.                
                <br><br>
                Aman Nath followed up with the Raja and bought the ruin with two Indian friends in 1986. They bought the fort 
                for Rs 700,000 in 1986 and restored it, opening as a hotel in 1991 with 12 rooms. After restoration, the fort, 
                which was built in 1464 under Chauhan Rulers[4] and had been a ruin for 40 years, open to guests. The hotel 
                has been used as the venue for the International Festival of Indian Literature in 2002, for Mastermind India, 
                conference, events and for dozens of dazzling weddings. But when the two original partners wanted to leave after 
                6 years and the hotel was running to much applause, Francis Wacziarg stepped in.
